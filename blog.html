						It's hard keeping friends up-to-date with adult life,
						especially if you live in different cities.
						So I'm writing a general update post to hit the highlights of the last few years.
						🤞🤞 Hopefully this isn't the last blog post I write!! 🤞🤞
					</p>


					<h2>Starting at the top: I got a job!</h2>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						After two full years of self/un/under-employment,
						I landed an actual big-boy job with a (significant hehe) salary.
						I'll finally be getting back to writing code for a living!!
						I just signed a contract with <a href="https://c3.ai">C3.ai</a>,
						where I'll be a generalist software engineer
						subcontracting for the federal government.
						Passing the technical interviews was incredibly nerve-wracking. I never like coding with someone over my shoulder,
						doubly so when there is a life-changing job hanging in the balance.
						But I didn't
						sit through dozens of lectures about computer science fundamentals to *not* know
						Big-O time complexity. Sure enough, I passed that stage (and the subsequent ones!) and was presented with an offer I couldn't refuse.
						The campus looks absolutely gorgeous, and the team seems really cool.
						I am so incredibly excited to see what interesting problems I'll be solving on
						a day-to-day basis. And don't worry, Cat has <i>STRICT</i> instructions to not let me become a stereotypical SF tech bro.

						<h2>Goodbye Sessions, I will genuinely miss you...</h2>

							Sessions West Coast Deli is an adorable little burger / beer / sandwich shop
							in Woodbridge, and only one of two restaurants with a view of the lake. It was a delightful place to work & earn rent while I was job-searching. I took every single one of my thirties by the lake, my coworkers were friendly and cool, and the customers were fun to chat with.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							One of my favorite things about Sessions was just HOW puppy friendly it was. Truly, the humans were just there to pay the tab. We used our plastic to-go boxes as puppy water bowls, and the dogs were usually SO excited to get a nice bowl of water. If that failed, I'd duck back into the kitchen and grab some salad chicken. I am not above bribing the affection of animals and small children.

					<h2 class="clear">Goodbye Southbrook  :(((</h2>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Yes, moving away from all our friends and family scares the absolute
						<i>SHIT</i> out of us. Her parents are here.
						Neither of my sisters are more than ninety minutes away.
						We love our friends so much. We're gonna miss board game nights,
						and D&D games over bowls of steaming pasta,
						and movie nights that are 5% movie and 95% chatting.
						We're really, really going to miss Irvine.
						Our Southbrook apartment was the first home we built together,
						and every corner of this cramped-ass one bedroom is full of memories we created.
						But we're taking this next step together,
						and I'm really excited to see the new home we make in the Bay Area
					</p>

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Holy shit we're gonna miss our friends so much. We're already planning our trips south, or virtual events, or literally anything to keep this amazing group of humans in our lives. From Pride Trains to brunch to blind Mario Kart, I love y'all <3
