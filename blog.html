					It's hard keeping friends up-to-date with adult life, 
					especially if you live in different cities. 
					So I'm writing a general update post to hit the highlights of the last few years.
					🤞🤞 Hopefully this isn't the last blog post I write!! 🤞🤞
					</p>


					<h2>Starting at the top: I got a job!</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					After two full years of self/un/under-employment, 
					I landed an actual big-boy job with a (significant hehe) salary. 
					I'll finally be getting back to writing code for a living!! 
					I just signed a contract with <b><a href="https://c3.ai">C3.ai</a></b>, 
					where I'll be a generalist software engineer
					subcontracting for the federal government.
					The campus looks absolutely gorgeous, and the team seems really cool.
					I am so incredibly excited to see what interesting problems I'll be solving on
					a day-to-day basis.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Yes, moving away from all our friends and family scares the absolute 
					<i>SHIT</i> out of us. Her parents are here. 
					Neither of my sisters are more than ninety minutes away. 
					We love our friends so much. We're gonna miss board game nights, 
					and D&D games over bowls of steaming pasta, 
					and movie nights that are 5% movie and 95% chatting. 
					We're really, really going to miss Irvine. 
					Our Southbrook apartment was the first home we built together, 
					and every corner of this cramped-ass one bedroom is full of memories we created.
					But we're taking this next step together, 
					and I'm really excited to see the new home we make in the Bay Area
					</p>
					<h2>Goodbye Sessions, I will genuinely miss you...</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Sessions West Coast Deli is an adorable little burger / beer / sandwich shop 
					in Woodbridge, and also only one of two restaraunts 
					</p>
